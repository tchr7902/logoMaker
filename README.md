# Logo Maker

## Description

This project was built in order to take user input, and produce a simple logo with the given parameters. This project was built in order to create a fast, free, and simple logo for web developers to use.

Creating this project taught me how to use Jest to test my code and ensure all functions were working correctly, how to use inquirer to take and pass along user inputs into a function, and also how to interact and use SVG.

## Usage

In order to use this project, all prerequisites must be installed, like node, inquirer, etc. Then, run 'node index.js' in the terminal, and answer the prompts given. This will create a logo.svg file with the given parameters, thus giving you a simple logo to use.
